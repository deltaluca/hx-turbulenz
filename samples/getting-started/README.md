Quick example adapted from Turbulenz documentation for getting started with Turbulenz quickly as a JS library.

Later examples will be slightly different, implemented as Turbulenz applications making use of Turbulenz build tools (Working for both canvas and plugin build modes).

Since we're not using the build tools here, the .html container has to be written manually.
